**Title:** Built a free‑tier “Content Machine” that turns ideas into posts (MVP)

**Post:**
I just built a small MVP called **content‑machine‑lite** — a free‑tier content pipeline for creators.

It does 3 things:
✅ pulls fresh ideas from RSS sources
✅ drafts a weekly content plan
✅ outputs everything into a clean markdown file

Why I built it:
Most creators spend more time *finding ideas* than actually creating. I wanted a simple system that removes the blank‑page problem.

What’s next:
- add Twitter/Reddit sources
- add scheduling integrations
- expand output formats (threads, newsletters, scripts)

If you’re a creator or agency and want to test it, DM me.
