# LinkedIn Post Draft (Professional)

**Title:** Built a free‑tier Content Machine MVP (idea → draft → ready to review)

**Post:**
I built a small MVP called **content‑machine‑lite** — a free‑tier content pipeline for creators and small teams.

**What it does:**
- pulls fresh ideas from RSS sources
- generates a weekly draft
- outputs everything into a clean markdown file

**Why:**
Creators spend too much time **finding ideas**. This tool reduces the blank‑page problem and keeps the workflow lightweight.

**What’s next:**
- add Reddit/YouTube sources
- optional scheduling integrations
- multi‑format outputs (threads, newsletter, scripts)
